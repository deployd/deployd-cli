## Submission Guidelines

### Submitting Issues

To help keep the issue count as low as it can be, it's important to [first review closed issues](https://github.com/deployd/deployd-cli/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) to make sure the issue is unreported and valid.

When reporting a bug, fill out the form correctly using the template.

### Submitting Pull Requests

These are the guidelines for submitting pull requests for new features or bugs:

 * Verify that the PR is not a duplicate to another PR
 * Make all changes in a new git branch
 * Follow the established [Code Submission Standards](#code-submission-standards)

## Code Submission Standards

To ensure consistency in code style, keep these standards
in mind as you work on code to submit to deployd:

 * All features or bug fixes must be tested by one or more specs in the `test` directory
 * All public APIs must be documented in our [docs](https://github.com/deployd/docs)
 * ESlint should be run against all changes without warnings
